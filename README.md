You can find our site hosted on fly.io [here](week-one-server-kgnl.fly.dev "Haikuniverse")

## Setup
Make sure you have Git and Node (v18) installed.

1. Clone this repo and cd into the directory
2. Run npm install to install all the dependencies
3. Run npm run dev to start the server.
- This uses the nodemon library to auto-restart the server when you save changes.

## Test
Our test folder contains a placeholder test.js file.

## Users Stories

- [ ] As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- [ ] As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

### Stretch User Story
- [ ] As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Deployed to Fly.io
- [ ] A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- [ ] No .html files (all HTML responses should be created dynamically within Node)
- [ ] No client-side JavaScript (all logic should happen on the server)
- [ ] All static assets served correctly (CSS, favicon etc)
- [ ] Tests for each server route
- [ ] A responsive, mobile-first design
- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
